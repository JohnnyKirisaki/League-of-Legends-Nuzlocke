# League-of-Legends-Nuzlocke
Simple application for tracking a League of Legends Nuzlocke run.

## What is a Nuzlocke?
The term **Nuzlocke** comes from a popular self-imposed challenge in *Pokémon*.  
The two core rules are:  
1. If a Pokémon faints, it is considered *dead* and can no longer be used.  
2. You must catch and use only the first Pokémon you encounter in each area.  

This transforms a casual playthrough into a high-stakes run where every decision matters.

## How it applies to League of Legends
In this app, the concept is adapted to *League of Legends*:  
- You’ll play champions **from A to Z** in order.  
- Each time you queue, you must lock in the *next available champion*.  
- If you **lose a game** with that champion, it’s considered *knocked out* and you must move on.  
- The challenge continues until you complete the full alphabet
